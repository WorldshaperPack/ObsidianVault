THE DEEP SEA
Key Points of Interest:
- Vent stream from hydrothermal vents
	- Various oxides, including Cu, Fe, Zn (for white smokers: Ba, Ca, Si)
- Access to underwater traversal (Submarine)
- Contact the native residents and exchange goods
	- Possibly a "manually trade with them for [[Deep Sea Science]] for tech that allows one to produce DSS"
- Extract molybdenum nodules
- Tame and exploit local fauna to further process waste products (Meat, Bio-sludge)
- Access to Bioluminescence
