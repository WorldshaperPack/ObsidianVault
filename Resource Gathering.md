# "ULV" Miner
Very early burner-type miner/drill running off steam/combustible fuels. Barely viable, but very cheap and (should) be obtainable within the first hour or three of gameplay. 
Produces basic minerals(Cu, Fe, Pb, Sn) at a low speed with high gangue/useless rock.
# POI Locations
Proposed concept of adding Points of Interest, such as geysers/wells (liquids/gasses) and deposits (minerals, sediments) for nigh-infinite production. They are appropriately rare
