# "ULV" Miner
Very early burner-type miner/drill running off steam/combustible fuels. Barely viable, but very cheap and (should) be obtainable within the first hour or three of gameplay. 
Produces basic minerals(Cu, Fe, Pb, Sn) at a low speed with high gangue/useless rock.
# POI Locations
Proposed concept of adding Points of Interest, such as geysers/wells (liquids/gasses) and deposits (minerals, sediments) for nigh-infinite production. They are appropriately rare and require solid infrastructure (Create trains) to exploit. 
# Deposits
Tweak regular GT deposits to be *stupidly* big (five chunks+). This would encourage/necessitate outpost construction, as even a big mining rig won't deplete it in one IRL day.
# Quarry 
Rather large (11x11?) multiblock that produces non-ore minerals and sediments at a low pace and reasonable gangue. A potential alternative to producing minerals on-site, but spacious and very energy-hungry. Could be supplemented with explosives. 
# Open-Pit Mine
Very large (21x21?) multiblock that can either:
- produce any ore minerals at extreme energy and space cost
- convert gangue and other useless rock into useful minerals
