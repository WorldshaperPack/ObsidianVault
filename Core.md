# [[GregTech fundamental rework]] ^5a707d
-  Reduce micro-crafting of greg, more similar to MI
- Reduce total tiers down TO EV/IV, as well as making less tier gated but rather use research and exponential infra requirements
- Likely remove certain components from all recipes and hide them, 
	more components is useless and just encourages passiving less
- change gt machine recipes to use the same common components
- recipes take higher quantity of items but have less crafts to achieve
- Likely change most covers to act as utility only rather than crafting components?
- move the secondary voltage materials to be part of other planets special seperate progressions
- upgradeable machine hulls using a universal upgrade component for singleblocks, 
	rather than having each machine have tiered parts
#  [[Research system]]
- this is used as a further progression gate, requiring players to build infra to unlock specific new things in progression rather  than just microcrafting their way to new toys, taking incrementally large amounts of science packs, with new science packs per tier of progression, as well as planet/dimension.
- Currently made with custom logic using FTBq and custom machinery, could possibly be replaced by a gt addon later on in dev
# [[Nerfing AE2]]
- ae2 will be heavily gated for every aspect of it aside from storage, maybe not including patterns at all
- likely start with storage off the bat, allowing crafting disks and drives, but not glass cables, fullblock energistics is added to use monitors without cables
# [[Early Resource Gathering]]
- starting with ulv miner of sorts? would be hard to balance it to not just be spammable? likely better to just have a manual mining more similar to factorio for starting resources
# [[GCyM replacements]]
- abs alloys likely removed and abs is repurposed for other things
- base GCyM's are removed and replaced by new multis with set parallel values, these multis have bigger and better tiers locked behind researches
- should probably do this through a coremod
- OR only keep a single tier of parallel multi, like 4x processing at hv with no more tiers, shouldn't need higher without ae2 on demand? later game stuff should have entirely different mechanics anyway to keep it fresh
