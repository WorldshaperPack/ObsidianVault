Metallurgy - Biology - Electricity
These three categories should provide a progression parallel to the planets and not inherently rely on planetary forays (i.e. all achievable from the home planets of t0-t1). 

Metallurgy covers Smelting, metalworking (production), refining and excavation/mining.
Biology is everything agriculture and [[Biotechnology]] - Exploiting plant and animal life.
Electricity is anything involving electricity - duh - electronics, regulations & control., circuitry, [[Nerfing AE2]].
