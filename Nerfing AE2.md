![[Core#Nerfing AE2]]

Approaching AE2 as a means to the measure, as tool instead of the universal solution.
I propose tiering access to components in a cascading way:
1. External Storage and I/O
	1. Storage Bus
	2. Interface
	3. Import and Export Bus
2. Simple Cabling
	1. Bare / Covered / Smart Fluix cables
3.  Basic Internal Storage 
	1. ME Storage cells up to 16k
4. Centralised Access 
	1. Terminals
5. Advanced Cabling 
	1. Bare/Covered/Smart Dense Cables
6. Advanced Internal Storage and Wireless
	1. Wireless Terminals
	2. Quantum Tunnels
	3. Remaining Storage Cells
7.
