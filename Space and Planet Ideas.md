- dimensional cannons mod for gating cross dimension item transport through shell tiers, also able to research portals for the dimensions for train transport
- waystones are disabled for gated planets, but when sufficiently through a planets progression
- you may research a gateway painting to travel between easily without a rocket (MAYBE)
- overworld and semiflat dimension are peaceful, most other dimensions are quite hostile
- Alexs caves moved to dimensions aka planets, used later in progression
- northstar or ad astra?? northstar fairly indev, unsure if gateable
	- MOST likely going to use the ad astra base 4 rocket tiers
- the Alex's planets are special and require a whole new infrastructure to be made,
	- using new resources from their environment/ecosystem, with their own science pack
- the base planets from base space mod are fairly generic, some things required for gating
- Moved unused Alex's mobs from the overworld to other planets where they seem fitting

- reskin enchantment books for space-proofing to look reasonable?
