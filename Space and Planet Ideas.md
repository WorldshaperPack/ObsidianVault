 - Space/planet ideas
	- dimensional cannons mod for gating cross dimension item transport through shell tiers
	- waystones are disabled for gated planets, but when sufficiently through a planets progression
	    you may research a gateway painting to travel between easily without a rocket
	- overworld and semiflat dimension are peaceful, most other dimensions are quite hostile
	- Alexs caves moved to dimensions aka planets, used later in progression
	- northstar or ad astra?? northstar fairly indev, unsure if gateable
	    - MOST likely going to use the ad astra base 4 rocket tiers
			- tier 0 - overworld/semiflat/nether/limbo
			- tier 1 - Moon, Primordial caves
			- tier 2 - Mars, Magnetic caves, candy cavity
			- tier 3 - Venus, mercury, forlorn hollows, abyssal depths
			- tier 4 - Glacio, toxic caves, 
	- the Alex's planets are special and require a whole new infrastructure to be made,
		- using new resources from their environment/ecosystem, with their own science pack
	- the base planets from base space mod are fairly generic, some things required for gating
	- Moved unused Alex's mobs from the overworld to other planets where they seem fitting
